{"content":"The following system of linear equations is given to Alice:\n","summary":"898x + 728y = 1249\n595x + 633y = 4163\nCan you find the values of x and y?\n\nStep 1: The goal is to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same. This is done by multiplying the entire first equation by 633 and the entire second equation by 728, leading to:\n\n568434x + 460824y = 790617\nand\n433160x + 460824y = 3030664\n\nStep 2: Now, subtract the second equation from the first. This involves subtracting each corresponding term on both sides. After performing the subtraction, we get:\n\n(568434-433160)x + (460824-460824)y = (790617-3030664)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = -16.559331431021484\n\nStep 3: We now know the value of x, so we substitute x = -16.559331431021484 into the first equation. The first equation becomes:\n\n898*-16.559331431021484 + 728y = 1249\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication 898*-16.559331431021484, which results in:\n\n-14870.279625057292 + 728y = 1249\n\nThen, isolate y by subtracting -14870.279625057292 from both sides. This gives us:\n\ny = 22.141867616836937\n\nStep 5: Thus, the solution to the system of equations is\n\nx = -16.559331431021484\nand\ny = 22.141867616836937."},

This involves subtracting each corresponding term on both sides. After performing the subtraction, we get:\n\n(205668-93496)x + (97712-97712)y = (1911688-532456)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 12.295688763684343\n\nStep 3: We now know the value of x, so we substitute x = 12.295688763684343 into the first equation. The first equation becomes:\n\n261*12.295688763684343 + 124y = 2426\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication 261*12.295688763684343, which results in:\n\n3209.174767321613 + 124y = 2426\n\nThen, isolate y by subtracting 3209.174767321613 from both sides.
