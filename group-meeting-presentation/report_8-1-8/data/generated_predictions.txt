After performing the subtraction, we get:\n\n(297758-159925)x + (95295-95295)y = (213351-391595)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 6.034865926221812\n\nStep 3: We now know the value of x, so we substitute x = 6.034865926221812 into the first equation. The first equation becomes:\n\n480*6.034865926221812 + 125y = 2779\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication 480*6.034865926221812, which results in:\n\n299.3283653322405 + 125y = 2779\n\nThen, isolate y by subtracting 299.3283653322405 from both sides. This gives us:\n\ny = -1.2457878800057795\n\nStep 5: Thus, the solution to the system of equations is\n\nx = 6.034865926221812\nand\ny = -1.2457878800057795"}

The first equation becomes:\n\n261*12.295688763684343 + 124y = 2426\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication 261*12.295688763684343, which results in:\n\n3209.174767321613 + 124y = 2426\n\nThen, isolate y by subtracting 3209.174767321613 from both sides. This gives us:\n\ny = -6.3159255429162355\n\nStep 5: Thus, the solution to the system of equations is\n\nx = 12.295688763684343", "predict": "495x + 180y = 2701\n778x + 364y = 490\nCan you find the values of x and y?\n\nStep 1: The goal is to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same. This is done by multiplying the entire first equation by 364 and the entire second equation by 180, leading to:\n\n218720x + 55360y = 851210\nand\n98248x + 55360y = 2700\n\nStep 2: Now, subtract the second equation from the first. This involves subtracting each corresponding term on both sides. After performing the subtraction, we get:\n\n(218720-98248)x + (55360-55360)y = (851210-2700)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 3.2203843637390864\n\nStep 3: We now know the value of x, so we substitute x = 3.2203843637390864 into the first equation. The first equation becomes:\n\n495*3.2203843637390864 + 180y = 2701\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication 495*3.2203843637390864, which results in:\n\n1879.08462040232075 + 180y = 2701\n\nThen, isolate y by subtracting 1879.08462040232075 from both sides. This gives us:\n\ny = -0.3417894588620402\n\nStep 5: Thus, the solution to the system of equations is\n\nx = 3.2203843637390864\nand"}
