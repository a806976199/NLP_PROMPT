This is done by multiplying the entire first equation by 715 and the entire second equation by 606, leading to:\n\n447590x + 433290y = 723580\nand\n196344x + 433290y = 2901528\n\nStep 2: Now, subtract the second equation from the first. This involves subtracting each corresponding term on both sides. After performing the subtraction, we get:\n\n(447590-196344)x + (433290-433290)y = (723580-2901528)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = -8.668587758611082\n\nStep 3: We now know the value of x, so we substitute x = -8.668587758611082 into the first equation. The first equation becomes:\n\n626*-8.668587758611082 + 606y = 1012\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation by performing the multiplication 626*-8.668587758611082, which results in:\n\n-5426.535936890537 + 606y = 1012\n\nThen, isolate y by subtracting -5426.535936890537 from both sides. This gives us:\n\ny = 10.624646760545442\n\nStep 5: Thus, the solution to the system of equations is\n\nx = -8.668587758611082\nand\ny = 10.624646760545442."},
